# Udacity FSND project 0 - Fresh Tomatoes movie trailer site

As the lengthy title would suggest this is project 0 for the Udacity FSND.
To view the demo visit [https://timbrockman.github.io/fsnd-p0-fresh-tomatoes/](https://timbrockman.github.io/fsnd-p0-fresh-tomatoes/).

## To generate the page:

The (updated) fresh_tomatoes.py file generates a single page YouTube trailer site.

In order to build the site you need python installed and to have this repo cloned locally.

Once you done that use the following command:

`python movies`

This will create a fresh fresh_tomatoes.html file. You can then view this page on your local machine.
